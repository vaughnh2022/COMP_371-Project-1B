### Profiler Notes
**Memory**: Overall, the memory stays between 1.9-2.6 Gb out of 8 Gb during the htop test.
**CPU**: The CPU usage was generally high while the program was running, as expected.
**Interpretation**: Since the memory is pretty much constant, the program's scalability is primarily limited by CPU performance, not memory, making this program scalable.
